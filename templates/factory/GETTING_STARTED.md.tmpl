## Application packages

The generated application supports npm workspaces below `code/packages/*`.
Packages are application-owned and must be imported through an explicit
composition root. The generic Next.js agent intentionally provides no package
scanner, self-registration mechanism, product contract, or deployment URL.

When adding a package, declare its exact dependency in `code/package.json`,
regenerate `code/package-lock.json`, and run lint, typecheck, tests, and a
production build. SaaS applications should consume the public SDK owned by the
SaaS Starter instead of creating a second contract in this template.
